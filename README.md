# Time_Series_Forecasting

### MODELING BITCOIN PRICE

#### Since Bitcoin launched in 2009, it has become widely popular because its trading system doesn’t need a third party and also due to high volatility of the price. In this project, 30 hold-out samples were selected for building a cyclical model of variable “High” with AR(2) serves as a fit error model and ARIMA model. Also, in this project, multivariate models were built to explore the correlations between High, Volumn, and Close. Model comparison was provided at the end of this paper.
